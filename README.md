# Demo Barcode Scanner

This is a demo barcode scanner based on this example: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.use_barcodescanner_example

The example code has been modified to broaden the types of barcodes supported by default and also add the scanned barcode value to the Product2.StockKeepingUnit field. This LWC should be placed directly on a Product2 lightning layout
